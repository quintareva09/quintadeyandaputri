Let's Work Together
Who Am I?

I'm a strategic communicator who doesn't optimize for heroics—I optimize for systems.

🔧 Design Systems

I don't do heroics. I build processes so good that other people can execute them without needing me. BiodiverseCities Poster System: 8 hours → 2 hours per poster. Scales to 12+ cities. Documented so it survives team changes.

💰 Translate Finance & Climate

NGFS scenarios, blended finance, NbS ROI, CSRD compliance—these are investor languages. I translate them into the language regulators, corporates, and the public actually understand.

🌍 Orchestrate Across Sectors

OJK (Indonesia's regulator), HSBC, WRI, WWF, IUCN, EU policymakers. Different audiences. One coherent narrative. Done.

Systems & Leadership Proof

BiodiverseCities Poster System

IUCN Europe | November 2025 | Systems Design Leadership

The Challenge

Create consistent, high-quality posters for 12+ EU pilot cities without requiring a designer for each one. Every pilot city has different context, but the same quality bar. How do you scale design without scaling the designer?

The Solution: A 5-Step Documented System

I built a workflow that combines Canva template (locked structure, variable content), Excel content collection (validation rules), QC checklist, EU compliance framework, and step-by-step instructions anyone can execute.

Step 1: Content Collection

Owner: Project Coordinator | Time: 30 minutes

Send Excel template to pilot lead. They fill in: city name, context, challenges, goals, actions, key lessons. Validation rules flag incomplete fields. Progress tracker shows completion percentage.

Step 2: Content Review & Refinement

Owner: Communications Team | Time: 20 minutes

Quality checks: Key lesson is specific (not vague). Challenges include data/numbers. Context is LOCAL, not generic. Actions are concrete, not hopes. No jargon citizens wouldn't understand.

Example fix: "We improved biodiversity" → "Native pollinator species increased 34% in 18 months"

Step 3: Design Production

Owner: Communications Team | Time: 90 min (first) → 45 min (subsequent)

Duplicate template. Copy/paste content from Excel. Replace placeholder image. Update city/country. Check EU compliance. Design is LOCKED (no fonts, colors, layout changes). This prevents scope creep and ensures consistency.

Step 4: Compliance & Quality Check

Owner: Senior Communications Officer | Time: 10 minutes

EU Compliance: EU flag is larger than any institutional logo. Interreg logo present. "Co-funded by the European Union" visible. All partner logos same size or smaller than EU flag.

Content Quality: No typos. Facts verified. Key lesson prominent. Image print-ready. City/country correct.

Step 5: Approval & Distribution

Owner: Project Manager | Time: 5 minutes

Send PDF proof to pilot lead (48-hour sign-off). Make corrections. Export files (PDF 300dpi CMYK for print, PDF 150dpi RGB for digital, PNG 1080x1080 for social). Archive in SharePoint with naming convention.

Impact

Time savings: 8 hours → 2 hours per poster (75% reduction)

Scalability: Works for all 12+ BiodiverseCities pilots without designer bottleneck

Compliance: EU rules built into process, not dependent on people remembering

Sustainability: System documented so it survives team changes (actually improves the org)

Quality: Consistent across all cities, automated checks, built-in standards

Why this matters: This proves you don't optimize for heroics—you optimize for systems. Good systems reduce dependency on one person, embed quality in the process itself, document so knowledge transfers, and scale without proportional cost increase.

Finance & Climate: Detailed Case Studies

🤝 Partnership Strategy & Brand Collaboration
BNI × WWF Credit Card Redesign & Partnership Integration

WWF-Indonesia × BNI | 2023-2024

The Challenge

How do you activate a major bank partnership at scale? BNI wanted to redesign their WWF co-branded credit card to drive conservation engagement. WWF needed coordinated messaging across social, press, and customer channels. The card itself is a product—but the story needs to reach millions who never see the physical product.

What I Did

Social Media Strategy & Coordination: Led all WWF social channels (Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok) for the partnership announcement and ongoing activation. Coordinated messaging with BNI comms team to ensure brand alignment while maintaining WWF voice.

Content Production: Created 15+ carousel posts, video teasers, and stakeholder announcements. Managed timing across platforms to maximize reach during card launch window.

Influencer & Partnership Activation: Coordinated with BNI marketing to identify complementary channels. Seeded messaging with journalists covering fintech/sustainability intersection.

Results

✓ Jakarta Globe coverage (major Indonesian business publication)

✓ 50,000+ impressions on launch week posts

✓ 12% engagement rate on card announcement (above WWF typical 4-6%)

✓ BNI reported 15,000+ new cardholders in first 3 months (attributed partly to social campaign)

✓ Partnership became template for future WWF corporate partnerships

♻️ Youth Mobilization & Plastic Innovation
Plastic Smart Cities: WWF × Bluebird × Youth Activist Network

WWF-Indonesia × Bluebird Taxi × Ministry of Environment | 2023-2024

The Challenge

How do you make plastic reduction tangible and youth-driven? Plastic Smart Cities needed to recruit youth activists, coordinate with corporate partners (Bluebird taxi), and scale across Indonesian cities. Youth engagement was critical but unpredictable—previous year had 300 applicants. Could we 3x that?

What I Did

Co-Leadership with Comms Officer: Partnered with WWF comms lead to design overall project strategy. I owned the youth activist communications pipeline and social media activation.

Youth Recruitment Strategy: Designed multi-channel campaign targeting university networks, climate action communities, and social media followers. Created Instagram carousel series explaining the program and application process.

Partnership Coordination: Managed social media collaboration posts with Bluebird, coordinated messaging with Ministry of Environment accounts, ensured YPBB (youth partner organization) brand visibility.

Content Creation: Produced 25+ posts documenting recruitment process, youth stories, partnership milestones, and campaign progress.

Results

✓ 1,000+ youth applicants (surge from 300 previous year = 233% growth)

✓ Campaign reel: 45,000+ views, 3,200+ engagements

✓ Partnership announcement: 28,000+ impressions

✓ Youth activist content: 18% engagement rate (vs. 6% WWF average)

✓ Bluebird partnership expanded to 3 additional cities based on success

✓ Ministry referenced project in national plastic reduction strategy

✓ YPBB (youth partner org) scaled programming based on applicant momentum

🌱 Strategic Repositioning
NetworkNature 2025: NbS as Corporate Investment

IUCN Europe | May-November 2025

The Challenge

How do you position Nature-based Solutions as a credible investment opportunity for EU corporate sustainability teams? Corporate leaders see NbS as too complex to quantify, unclear ROI, difficult to scale.

What I Did

Audience Research: Researched what corporate sustainability teams actually ask: "How do I demonstrate NbS impact to my CFO?" "Which NbS solutions are investment-ready?" "How do I ensure real outcomes?"

Message Reframing: BEFORE: "NbS protects biodiversity" (doesn't resonate with finance). AFTER: "NbS delivers €3-5 ROI per €1 invested while meeting CSRD requirements" (speaks finance language).

Campaign Architecture (4 Phases): Phase 1 (May-June): Awareness. Phase 2 (July-August): Proof points (real corporate case studies). Phase 3 (August-Sept): Event value prop. Phase 4 (Sept): Call-to-action.

Analytics-Driven Optimization: Tested what resonated. Case studies with ROI data: 6.8% engagement. Regulatory framing: 5.2%. Generic "NbS is good": 2.1%. Shifted 60% of content to case studies + regulatory framing after seeing analytics.

Data Validation: Used R to analyze cost-effectiveness of NbS vs. gray infrastructure. Collected data from 15 NbS projects across EU. Key finding: NbS 30-40% cheaper than gray infrastructure for flood protection. This became core talking point.

Results

✓ 200+ event attendees (EU policymakers, corporate leads, researchers)

✓ 15% of registrations from LinkedIn campaign

✓ 35% engagement improvement (39.85% peak vs. 18.5% baseline)

✓ 9,420 peak impressions on top post

✓ 24.7% sustained engagement across 4-month campaign

✓ 81.5% improvement in daily follower acquisition

✓ 3 corporate pilot projects initiated post-event

Let's Talk

I'm building toward a career leading sustainable finance communications strategy at banks, asset managers, and development finance institutions. I design systems that scale, translate climate/nature frameworks for capital allocation, and coordinate across sectors.

If your organization needs someone who bridges quants, regulators, and stakeholders—someone who thinks like a systems engineer and communicates like a storyteller—let's talk.
